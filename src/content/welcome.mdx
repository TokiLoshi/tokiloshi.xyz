Welcome to TokiLoshi.xyz

Hi! I'm Bianca, but my friends call me Bee (or Toki).

I'm a creative developer who loves building playful 3D experiences on the web, with full-stack capabilities.

I've been meaning to create my portfolio for a while, but kept hitting my head on the idea that it had to be some wildly impressive 3D experience.

While refactoring my cozy room personal media tracker (the creep of scope is alive and well - and honestly, I'm loving it), I realized a better approach would be to build in public by writing short devlogs, process where I'm getting stuck outloud, and document what I'm learning as I go.

This is a site for those adventures (and occasional misadventures), as well as a place to share my work and invite connection and collaboration.

If you want to chat about anything here, share what you're building or ask a question, feel free to reach out - here or on X (**@3DBeeing**).
